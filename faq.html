            <summary>How does the contract-based system work?</summary>
            <p>
                You submit an online contract via our website. After submitting, the contract will have a status of <code>Pending</code>. After the product is delivered to you, the contract will have a status of <code>Delivered</code>. The contract is renewed on a yearly basis for free. The renewal is for inspections and maintenance purposes. There is also a baseline 1-year warranty.

            <summary>Can I opt out of inspections?</summary>
            <p>
                You can opt out of inspections for most products, except fire extingushers, fire hoses, and sprinklers. Fo the aformentioned products, inspections are mandatory, thus opting out of them requires cancelling/not renewing the product, which means your product will not be supported by Monoxxal Safety Systems.
