                <h2>I: Founding</h2>
                <p>
                    On the 12<sup>th</sup> of May, 1987, when Dr. Leonardo Kamau arrived home from work, he was met with a terrifying sight; the bodies of his wife and two children lay on the floor of the kitchen and dining room. All of a sudden, he started feeling dizzy, and he rushed out of the house to get some fresh air. As he came to his senses, he realised what had happened; his family had suffered from <abbr title="Carbon Monoxide">CO</abbr> asphyxiation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Dr. Kamau was distraught. He knew his family's deaths were easily preventable had he installed a CO detector. However, these systems were few at the time, and they were not even made in the country and had to be imported with very high levies. Thus, he knew that something had to be done about this issue to prevent such needless deaths.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As he was working a stable high-end job as a director of the Standard Chartered Bank, he put together some money, and on the 26<sup>th</sup> of September 1987, he opened a small shop that sold imported fire extinguishers and smoke detectors. He named the shop <i>Monoxxal<pre>(from <q>monoxide</q>)</pre> Smoke Detectors and Fire Extinguishers</i>.

                <p>
                    At first, no one seemed interested in buying these equipment, as safety measures were seen as a chore, and most people were living hand-to-mouth. This, in combination with the high levies imposed upon importation, caused Monoxxal to undergo heavy losses, forcing Dr. Kamau to take heavy loans in order to keep the shop afloat. However, he had a brilliant idea.
                </p>
                <p>
                    He started a massive campaign on the importance of safety measures in workplaces, institutions, and households. He utilised statistics and anecdotal illustrations. He even handed out pamphlets with information that was easy to digest. Two investors, namely Mr. Ludwig Wafula and Mr. Juma Macho, noticed Dr. Kamau's efforts, and offered Kshs.2,000,000.00 (currently about Kshs.70,572,902.74) in exchange for a 25% stock market share.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This newfound funding, alongside the increase in sales revenue as a result from the campaigns, not only saved Monoxxal from bankruptcy, but also enables its expansion. By 1990, it had increased its size from one small shop in Lang'ata, to a network of 15 stores across Kenya. By 2000, this number had grown to 35.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 2003, when the national economy boomed, the government was providing incentives for manufacturing. Monoxxal seized this opportunity and opened a manufacturing plant in Ngong Town that made smoke detectors and fire extinguishing equipment such as hoses and cylinders.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 2009, when the government reinforced safety regulations, Monoxxal saw a massive uptick in revenue. As a result, the company branched out into making general safety equipment such as sprinklers, floodlights, burglary alarms, illuminated exit signs and other signage. The company formally changed its name to <i>Monoxxal Safety Systems</i>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 2015, Monoxxal Safety Systems changed its model from a one-time-sale model to a contract-based model. This meant that while payments were still done the way they were done as before, a contract meant that an inspector was sent to check on the state of the components purchased every once in a while. This was done to ensure accountability and trust between Monoxxal and the client.

                    Currently, Monoxxal has over 50 branches across the country, with the main headquarters being in Ngong Town. Monoxxal has over 1100 employees, and has sold over 45 million fire extinguishers, 23 million smoke detectors, and 15 million units of other equipment.
