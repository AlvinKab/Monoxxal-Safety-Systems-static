            <li>
                To use a fire extinguisher, remove the safety pin, aim at the base of the fire, and press the lever. A fire extinguisher should not go for more than 6 months without inspection by a safety officer.
            </li>
            <li>
                Always remember to replace your smoke detector batteries. If your smoke detector produces the following beeping sound every 30-60 seconds, replace the baterries immediately.

            <li>
                Ensure that building codes and regulations are followed. Remember that most building codes were written in blood, which means that they were created to combat deaths and save lives. Buildings must be accessible to all, and safet standards must be adhered to. <em>Don't cheap out</em>.
            </li>
            <li>
                In the case of a fire or any other emergency, try your best to be composed and stay calm. Chaos only creates more chaos. Walk to the mearest fire exit, gather at a designated assembly point, and call emergency services.
            </li>
            <li>
                Ensure that the building you are currently in has good ventilation, and that any potential source of CO is sealed off when not in use. This will reduce your chances of asphyxiation.
            </li>
            <li>
                In an institution or building, fire drills sould be conducted at least twice a year in order to familiarise workers/students with standard emergency practices.
            </li>
            <li>
                Inspect your house or a laboratory for gas leaks frequently, and deal with them with immediate effect if found.
            </li>
            <li>
                In a room with many moving parts such as computer CPU fans, it is recommended that you use a <abbr title="Carbon Dioxide">CO<sub>2</sub></abbr> fire extingisher, as powder and foam may damage moving parts.
            </li>
            <li>
                Emergency hotlines are as follows:
                <ul>
                    <li>[999|911|112]: Toll-free numbers.</li>
                    <li>[020-2222181|020-2222182|020-2344599]: Public emergency numbers.</li>
                </ul>
